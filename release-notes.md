- Bump terminology to 1.8.1 to fix dependency URL from file://C:\Users\TMS\TMS\GitHub\MedComPublication\dk-medcom-terminology\output to a proper url
- Remove EasEndpoint in favor of EEREndpoint
- Removed type[EerMessagingOrganizationType] and type[EerSorOrganizationType] on EasMessagingOrganization
- Aliases in examples all pointed to /dk-ehmi-terminology/ canonical url's rather than just /terminology/
- Examples of EasMessagingOrganization have had a required slice 'type[SOR-Hierarchy]' which weren't properly set. It has been resolved. The examples pointed to snomed codes but have changed to an EER valueset
